This repository contains all files relating to the project; INVESTIGATIVE STUDY OF NANO-CEMENT AS A REPLACEMENT FOR CEMENT IN CONSTRUCTION USING MACHINE LEARNING MODELS
The research paper addressed the application of nanotechnology in construction. The study showed that local materials like silica sand, 
and waste such as slag, fly ash, etc., at the nanoscale could improve the technical strength of concrete and other cement-based products. 
These nanoparticles also have carbon neutrals that help to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Nanocement, which refers to the cement derived from nanoparticles, 
formed the basis of this study. The research paper employed machine learning algorithms to determine the compressive strength of concrete made from nanoparticles. 
The machine learning algorithms used in this paper were K-Nearest Neighbour, Random Forest Regressor, CatBoost Regressor, and XGBoost Regressor. 
The study used Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and the Coefficient of Determination (R squared) to evaluate the models.
The best-performing model was deployed using FastAPI for interactive usage, and the link to the app is in the body of the paper. In addition, 
this research paper explained the need for Portland cement to be replaced with cement containing nano silica and micro silica (nanocement). 
The effect of nano silica and micro silica on the early-age compressive strength of concrete was thoroughly evaluated and compared. 
It was concluded that the partial replacement of cement with nanoparticles significantly increased the compressive strength of concrete, 
and hence, nano cement should be embraced.
